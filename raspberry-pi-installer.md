# Install FlightAware, PlaneFinder and FlightRadar24 on a raspberry pi already running dump1090

sudo apt full-upgrade
sudo reboot
```
Download and install the FlightAware APT repository package, which tells your Pi's package manager (apt) how to find FlightAware's software packages in addition to the packages provided by Raspbian.

```
wget https://www.flightaware.com/adsb/piaware/files/packages/pool/piaware/f/flightaware-apt-repository/flightaware-apt-repository_1.2_all.deb
sudo dpkg -i flightaware-apt-repository_1.2_all.deb
```
Update your apt package sources and install PiAware. This will install all the required dependencies on your Raspberry Pi.
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install piaware
```
Enable automatic and manual (web-based, via your request) PiAware software updates. These updates are disabled by default. To leave updates disabled, skip this step.
```
sudo piaware-config allow-auto-updates yes
sudo piaware-config allow-manual-updates yes
```

```
sudo apt install dump1090-fa
```
